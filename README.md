# Practical task repository for Functions

## General Task Guidelines

* Please, **don't** change the **.NET version** of the projects.
* Please, **don't** change the **pipeline definition** (`.gitlab-ci.yml`).
* Please, make corrections as per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
* The task repository may contain **one or more than one** practical task per given topic, you are expected to **complete all the tasks**.
* The programming language to be used is **C#**. It is not mandatory to use the latest features of the available .NET version.
* It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
* A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated from the below mentioned review process.
* **ThirdParty folder** - while making changes, any files contained inside the "**ThirdParty**" folder **must not** be changed. These files are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of it.
* **Unit tests** - Some tasks have unit tests implemented, if they exist, they are comprehensive and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green.
* **Modifying unit tests** - You can modify tests as long as there is **no change in the behavior (e.g. test assertions)** of the tests. You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.
* **Logic and behavior of the code need to be preserved.**
